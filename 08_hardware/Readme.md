Selecting a Raspberry Pi version
---------------------------------
My initial plan was to re-use an old *Raspberry Pi Model B* (which is more than adequate regarding speed and memory), but the WiFi connection via USB dongle proved to be unreliable. Restarting the driver via a script called from a cron-job did not help either.
Moving to a *Raspberry Pi 3 Model A+* solved this issue. This version was selected as a good compromise between power consumption, size, price and processing power.

Connector J4
-------------
Due to the initial plan using a *Raspberry Pi Model B*, a 26-pin header was used. For changing to a *Raspberry Pi 3*, a ribbon cable with a 26-pin-connector on one side and a 40-pin-connector on the other side was used. **It is highly recommended to use a 40-pin header in new designs!**

High Side Driver Infineon BTS621L1
-----------------------------------
The driver works fine, but the device package seems to be outdated (and is not very practical for breadboard designs). For a redesign, I used the [Infineon BTS117](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/power/smart-low-side-high-side-switches/low-side-switches/classic-hitfet-24v/bts117/) *"N channel vertical power FET in Smart SIPMOSÂ® technology"*. The latter is a single channel low-side switch and provides less diagnostic functions, but is available in a handy TO220-3 package. 

Breadboard vs. printed circuit board
-------------------------------------
It's a matter of taste, but next time I would rather design a printed circuit board and have it made by a PCB service. In the original design an *RND 455-00555* prototype board (67.8x86.9mm) by *RND Components* was used. 

Barometric Pressure Sensor connector (J1)
------------------------------------------
For new designs, I prefer a *Bosch BME280* instead of the *NXP MPL115*. The *BME280* provides temperature, humidity and barometric pressure with (in my opinion) excellent specifications.
