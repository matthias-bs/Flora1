[Infineon BTS621L1](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/power/smart-low-side-high-side-switches/high-side-switches/classic-profet-12v-automotive-smart-high-side-switch/bts621l1-e3128a/) "High side power switch with integrated vertical power FET".
The TO220-7 package version seems to be discontinued.

For a redesign, I used the [Infineon BTS117](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/power/smart-low-side-high-side-switches/low-side-switches/classic-hitfet-24v/bts117/) "N channel vertical power FET in Smart SIPMOSÂ® technology". The latter is a single channel low-side switch and provides less diagnostic functions.
